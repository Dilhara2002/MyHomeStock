# HomeStock

HomeStock is a smart web application that helps users manage their home inventory and shopping list. It automatically tracks low-stock items, suggests what to buy, and keeps everything organized by categories. Users can also manage their accounts securely, and get reports like frequently purchased items or out-of-stock alerts. Our goal is to make home management simple, efficient, and smart.

Built with Node.js, MongoDB, and Gemini API.
